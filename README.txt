Sunrise/Sunset Tweets
----------------------


What:
-----

This is a active running program to tweet out the sunrise and sunset of a particular city, in their particular time zone.


How:
1. Determine where all your files are.

2. Open up terminal and change directories according to the location of the files.
(ls (figure where your files are), cd (change directory to appropriate place))

3. Once ready, run the file through python, along with the city and state.
(example:~/Desktop$ python3 astrotweet.py irvine ca (*Use quotes if there is a space between city))

4. If done correctly, the program should tweet out the sunrise and sunset time at 3:00AM. Twitter: @yimmyvo
